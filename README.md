# ARcadeGuardians
This project takes place in a class I attend at my HCI Master, Mixed Reality &amp; Tangible Interactions. The aim is to create a Tower Defense game where map &amp; ennemy would be virtual, and tower &amp; spells would be represented by tangible objects with marker's attached to it.
